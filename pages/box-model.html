    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The box model is used to put your Elements exactly where you want them to be.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>The Basics</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>You can use <em>margin</em>, <em>padding</em> and <em>borders</em> to make sure elements are just the right size.<br>
        To get a grasp of how the box model works, you basically have to imagine every single HTML-element as a box. You can actually make these boxes visible with CSS by entering the code * {border: 2px solid red;}.
        However - the above mentioned elements work as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>padding - increase space between border of a box and content of box</li>
            <li>margin - increase space between borders of box and adjacent box</li>
            <li>border - adds space between margin and padding</li>
        </ul>
